  // A common (already!?) mistake people make with Context Providers is creating a
  // new object in the render method. Doing this will force the re-render of all
  // consumers even if no changes were actually made to the state we're exposing.
  // In this simple example the Toggle's render method wont run unless state was
  // changed in a way that would necessitate a re-render of consumers anyway, so
  // quite honestly it doesn't make a difference in this simple scenario, but it's
  // better to err on the side of caution than unecessary re-renders in this case.

  // ü¶â note that if you didn't want to expose _all_ your `state`, then you could
  // place things on a state property called `context`, but then any time you update
  // that state you'd have to do some extra work... Give it a try and you'll learn

    // other patterns), then you can do this:

// üê∏ It's my moment to shine! This is a function that returns a component. So we call it

// The usefulness of this component is a bit lost in this simple example because the

// simplify common use cases and help prevent deeply nested render prop consumers.

// ü¶â Felicity didn't want to mention this, but it should be noted that HOCs are strictly

// the HOC at app initialization time) rather than dynamic (you consume a render prop
// in every render phase).
